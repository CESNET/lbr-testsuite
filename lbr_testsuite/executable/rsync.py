class Rsync:
    """Implement data synchronization.

    Synchronization can be done between directories on
    local machine or between local and remote machine.

    Parameters
    ----------
    executor : executable.Executor, optional
        Executor to use. If not set, use local executor (run
        commands on local machine).
    data_dir : str, optional
        Data directory on host.
        Host can be local or remote.
        Files pushed (uploaded) to host will be in
        this directory.
        If not set, temporary directory is created.
        Temporary directory is reused during single
        session (per-host and per-user, meaning each
        user has own directory on each different host).
        By default, this means that synchronized files
        can be shared by multiple tests in one session.

        Warning: method wipe_data_directory() removes
        everything inside this directory, so
        don't use home directory or cwd (~ or .) etc.

    Raises
    ------
    RsyncException
        Could not prepare temporary directory.
